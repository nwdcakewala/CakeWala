            I really like the atmosphere, good coffee, and nice interior. This is a good place to study or chill with friends. The drinks and foods were all tasty and worthwhile. If you're up for a fresh place with beautiful old architecture then this is a must to visit.

                Will go again, I only popped in to get take-away cappuccinos, but I was struck by how friendly the service was. The cappuccinos were wonderful too! And very well priced.

                I would probably say that this café is a must for coffee lovers! The service was good, and the variety of coffee served in the ambiance was very satisfying. We will be back again!
